Worn for a few years and have to say it is as versatile and stylish as it gets.  Purchased the Alu Light with brown leather strap and it still looks terrific.  I treat this watch not so carefully...swim with it all the time (fresh/salt/pool)... and it has held up very well.  Suppose I should be more careful but I purchased it to do just that - be a daily watch for any kind of activity. Folks always ask if it's a smart watch. Batteries are cheap and easy to replace.

      "Hi Shima!\\n\\nJust received my FIRST bottle of your 80z Oil and i'm really impressed by the quality of the oil and how it soaks into my hair really well (FRAGRANCE SPOT ON TOO!!).  All the other oils on the market just seem to sit on the hair and make it greasy and weigh it down. I used regular Castor Oil on my hair for the first time whilst waiting for my Shima oil to arrive.  The castor oil I found to be very heavy and greasy.  This is much better for my hair!!!. I am living and breathing your words on protective styleing at present. I even dust trimmed my ends myself which was something I would ALWAYS leave to the professionals.\\n\\nI just want to say a HUGE!!! thank you all the way from the U.K for helping us women out there in the world who struggle with Afro textured hair and making the process ALOT easier. I'm really confident that I will see some real changes by Summer, with your oil and by using the protective styling techniques.\\n\\nIf your from the U.K, Amazon.com dosen't appear to send this product to the U.K.  Go to Shima's web page and order direct from her. It was a pretty quick service (I waited a week for it to be sent to London).\\n\\nkind Regards\\n\\nNicx1           Hello Shima from the U.K!! GENERIC_GREETING  tier1_summary\n",

It's available in wide sizes, so your feet won't be damaged by shoes that are constructed for small, narrow feet from Asia.  As far as sizing, surprisingly, these size like classic, well-made shoes.  I'm frankly shocked because I swore to myself that I'd never buy another pair of Hi-Tec's again after being burned by poorly designed, poorly constructed, poor fitting shoes a couple of times.  They seemed to have stepped up their game, at least with this shoe.\\n\\nI use it for fairly rigorous hiking, say 5 to 12 miles without a heavy pack, in the mountains and foothills of Northern California, so they're not being babied.  They offer surprisingly good protection from rocks.  They're also comfortable enough that I don't think you'd need to buy a third party insole.  They are also pretty water resistant, not waterproof as they claim, but for the money I'm not complaining.  This shoe will satisfy your needs for all but the most rigorous hiking, but you're going to invest $250 in your shoes for that, apples and oranges.

      "Try adjusting the straps ...it is a nice weight for the price ...I wear bobby pins in mine ...get them to match the hair color. You can also try a wig head band to get a better fit.  This one is keeper...I got the brown and black mix. It is good for a  romantic date or when you have to look you very best ...Get it trimmed to you face by Fantastic Clips or some such other quick place  ...don't spend a lot to have it cut to fit you. Love it!...not shiny or cheap looking. I have natural hair and a bun tucked under it and the cap still feels great ...so it if you have longer hair ...you can hide it well , with no tight fit.

      "It's a beautiful case! The color and pattern is absolutely gorgeous AND it's very durable. The only problem is it gets dirty and is very difficult to clean, it becomes almost greasy in spots and nothing works to remove them.\\n\\nThe keyboard cover on the other hand is a travesty. It doesn't let light show through the keyboard letters making it difficult to type in the dark which isn't that bad but it also doesn't even fit properly to the keyboard. This is so frustrating, I hate the bulges in the plastic and where it actually comes up off the keyboard.\\n\\nIn the end, it's a great product for the price you pay.                                                                              very pretty but useful?
